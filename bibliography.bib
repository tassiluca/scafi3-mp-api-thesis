  abstract  = {Software portability is often cited as desirable, but rarely receives systematic attention in the software development process. With the growing diversity of computing platforms, it is increasingly likely that software of all types may need to migrate to a variety of environments and platforms over its lifetime. This tutorial is intended to show the reader how to design portability into software projects, and how to port software when required.},
