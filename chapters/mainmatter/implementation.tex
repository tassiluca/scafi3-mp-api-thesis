\subsection{Distribution module}

Enabling distribution in ScaFi3 requires implementing an abstract network manager that is able to send and receive Value Trees \todo{in context add Value Tree} from and to neighbor devices.
%
The AC framework abstract over the specific protocol used to communicate and the neighborhood discovery mechanism, allowing the implementation of different network managers for different protocols and scenarios.

As a first step towards a full-featured distributed ScaFi3, a socket-based network manager has been implemented, leveraging stream, TCP-based connection-oriented sockets.
%
As shown in \Cref{fig:socket-network-manager-architecture}, each device is bound to a specific endpoint (IP address and port) and communicates point-to-point with its neighbors.

Despite the low-level nature of sockets, they provide a foundational abstraction layer that many higher-level protocols ultimately rely upon (such as HTTP, MQTT, etc.), making them a suitable starting point for building extensible communication mechanisms.
