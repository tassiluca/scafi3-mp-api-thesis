# Master thesis document

1. Introduction
2. Context and Motivations
   1. The centrality role of portability: os -> C compiled code -> java byte code to be "run everywhere"
   2. Why caring other platforms and the role of modern programming languages targeting different platforms
      1. The impact in terms of programming: addressing the abstraction gap — https://unibo-spe.github.io/12-multiplatform/#/16
   3. Why caring about making the API of a software product interoperate with other languages?
      1. Different languages, different runtimes and different **ecosystems** — https://unibo-spe.github.io/12-multiplatform/#/11 — https://unibo-spe.github.io/12-multiplatform/#/6
      2. The opposite approach: calling from the "super" language libraries from other languages (e.g. Scala <- Python libraries)
      3. Why choosing a language as a reference? The role of abstraction in software engineering
3. State of the art:
   1. How kotlin and scala deal with portability and abstraction gap
   2. The approach of Cazzola et. al (not consider multi-target language like kotlin and scala)
   3. Spark architecture?
   4. Why caring for aggregate computing. Btw, what is Aggregate Computing?
